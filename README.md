# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

As part of our analysis we were tasked with helping the hiring manager of “Pewlett-Hackard” to determine staffing levels in the future as well as opportunities to fill roles that 
will soon be open. The manager was concerned about the upcoming “silver tsunami” and tasked us with finding the total number of employees reaching retirement age, as well as 
determining the job titles those individuals hold in order to help determine where future positions will be vacant. Additionally we helped find employees that would be eligible 
for a mentorship program in order to help promote within the company.

## Results

- The first conclusion drawn from the query in deliverable one is that a large percentage of those retiring hold senior positions within the company. In fact “Senior Staff” and 
“Senior Engineers” makeup over 45% of the total employees retiring. To fill these positions Pewlett-Hackard will need to hire skilled workers, or promote from within. 

- The second conclusion drawn from the deliverable is that the majority of those retiring are from the engineering department of the company. “Assistant Engineers”, “Senior 
Engineers”, and “Engineers” makeup over 51% of the total. This indicates that the company should focus on recruiting more candidates with an engineering background in order to 
fill these positions. 

- From our second deliverable we can see that a large number of the staff eligible for the mentorship program are in fact currently engineers. This suits the company well, and 
will save them time and money by giving them an internal pool of staff to promote from. Focus should be placed on targeting these staff members and recruiting them into senior 
positions. 

- The fourth conclusion drawn from our tables is that those eligible for promotions are dwarfed by those retiring, confirming the hiring managers fears of the “silver tsunami”. 
While the mentorship program can help alleviate some of the pain felt by the large wave of senior employees retiring, we can confirm that more will need to be done in order to 
fill the ranks inside of Pewlett-Hackard.

## Summary

In short, while the mentorship program can help with the sudden windfall in staffing, more will need to be done. I would suggest targeting new engineers entering the workforce, as 
well as employees in similar, lower roles as those needed at other companies. A helpful table may be the sum of salaries for the positions being vacated by employees to help 
determine the wage at which Pewlett-Hackard can offer new comers, as well as a potential forecast of employees retiring in the not so near future, in order to formulate a strategy 
moving forward.
